# Security Review for LibraryProject

## Implemented Security Measures

1. **Enforced HTTPS**
   - Configured `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` to ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
   - Added HSTS (`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000`, `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True`, `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True`).

2. **Cookie Security**
   - Enabled `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

3. **Secure Headers**
   - `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"` to prevent clickjacking.
   - `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` to stop MIME-type sniffing.
   - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` to mitigate cross-site scripting.

4. **Deployment**
   - Added Nginx SSL configuration with Let's Encrypt certificates.
   - Configured automatic redirect from HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443).

## Potential Improvements
- Consider using `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` headers for advanced XSS protection.
- Enable automatic certificate renewal with Certbot for seamless HTTPS maintenance.
